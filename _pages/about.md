I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), working with Professor [Matthew Caesar](https://caesar.cs.illinois.edu/). My research lies at the intersection of large language models, distributed systems, and network resilience, with a focus on developing robust and efficient systems to address real-world challenges in network systems and AI.

I earned my undergraduate degree from the Lahore University of Management Sciences, where I worked with Professor Fareed Zaffar on projects involving software debloating and deepfake detection.
