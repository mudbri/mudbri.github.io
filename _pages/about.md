Bio
------
I am a Computer Science PhD candidate at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), working with Professor Matthew Caesar. My research focuses on the intersection of large language models, distributed systems, and network resilience. I am committed to building robust and efficient systems that address real-world challenges in computing and generative AI.

I completed my undergraduate studies at Lahore University of Management Sciences, where I collaborated with Professor Fareed Zaffar on projects focused on software debloating and deepfake detection.
